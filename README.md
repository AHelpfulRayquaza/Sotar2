# Sotar2
Yet another Bot for Pokemon Showdown!

# Command list!

### -ivs
-ivs is a command where you can use if you want to find out the ivs for a certain type, or find out what a certain set of ivs is. Here's an example:

Zeruora: -ivs ground

*A Rando Bot: IV's required for Ground type Hidden Power: 30/30/30/31/30/30, 31/31/31/30/30/31, 30/31/31/30/30/31, 31/30/31/30/30/31

Or it can be used the other way found

### -pokemon
-pokemon is a simple but useful command that uses html to show some information about the pokemon specified. It will show four sprites of the Pokemon (front, back, shiny front, shiny back), then 3 helpful links about the Pokemon. It will then show the stats and everything about the pokemon via !dt.

### -dice
Pretty self-explanatory but it's just rolling some normal dice.
