# Sotar2
Another Bot for Pokemon Showdown!

# Introduction

Sotar2 is the second version of the original bot 'Sotar'. It is based off Universal Backup, but without the numerous Mafia commands. 

# Command list

Sotar2 has many simple but useful commands. Here is a list of some of them
WARNING: new commands are being made all the time.

1. pokemon [pokemon] - this command gives 4 sprites of any given pokemon. It gives front, back, and front and back shiny. It also gives useful websites and information about the Pokemon. Bot requires * to use this command.

2. ivs [ivset] or [type] - if you use a type, the bot gives all the EV spreads that will make Hidden Power that type. If you give an IV set, it will give you the type and power. Usefulif you don't wanna open the teambuilder

There are more which I can't be bothered to list.
